    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is apparently Ariel Sharon's favourite dish from Bayt Jala's Qabar Restauraunt.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil (EVOO)</li>
        <li>potato (likely russet)</li>
        <li>garlic cloves (young and decored)</li>
        <li>lemons (fresh)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Scrupulously peel enough cloves of garlic to half-fill your blender.</li>
        <li>Top with an equally scrupulously peeled and boiled white potato.</li>
        <li>Add the juice of one fat lemon.</li>
        <li>Add to that enough olive oil to mostly cover the solid ingredients, and whip it as if you were making a mayonnaise, until it has become a snow-white emulsified mass with the texture of whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Serve with roasted meats, such as spatchcocked chicken.</li>
    </ol>
